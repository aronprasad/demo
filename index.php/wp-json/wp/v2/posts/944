Despite the progress we have made in advocating for gender equality, women and girls continue to be subjected to various forms of violence\u2014irrespective of their race, language, or religion. International Women&#8217;s Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women are observed annually to spotlight these issues and to compel action from governments, organizations, and individuals alike. Yet, the atrocities persist, often beginning within the walls of our own homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fear that mothers have for their daughters is not rooted merely in the fact that they have given birth to a girl, but in the societal conditions into which that child is born. In many homes, boys learn oppressive behavior from the very people they trust and admire\u2014their family members. These boys, nurtured in environments that subtly or overtly condone gender inequality, grow into men who perpetuate the cycle of violence and discrimination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just a societal issue; it is a deeply personal one that must be addressed at its roots. Change must begin with the family, where values are first taught and behaviors first observed. It is incumbent upon every parent to instill in their sons the principles of respect and equality from an early age. Boys must be raised to understand that men and women share equal rights, and that everyone, regardless of gender, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By nurturing these values in our children, we can foster a society where men and women coexist as equals\u2014where respect is not gendered, and where violence against women is unequivocally condemned. The task is not easy, but it is necessary. As parents, as educators, and as members of society, we have a responsibility to guide the next generation towards a future free from gender-based violence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us all take this responsibility to heart. Let us teach our boys to respect girls, to value equality, and to champion the rights of all individuals. In doing so, we will raise a generation that is self-confident, courageous, and committed to creating a world where women are respected as much as men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alagurani<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Violence against women remains one of the most pervasive and deeply rooted human rights violations worldwide.
