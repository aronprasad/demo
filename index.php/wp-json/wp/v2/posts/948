It is a day that honors the tens of thousands of workers who, many years ago, fought valiantly for their rights. Yet, despite the sacrifices made, the battle for fair labor conditions is far from over. The recent opposition in Tamil Nadu to the 12-hour workday bill is a stark reminder of the ongoing labor unrest and the critical importance of remembering the origins of this significant day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when workers were ruthlessly exploited, forced to toil for more than 16 hours a day under inhumane conditions. It was Karl Marx who first articulated the idea that a worker&#8217;s day should be divided into three equal parts: 8 hours for work, 8 hours for rest, and 8 hours for sleep. This simple yet revolutionary concept inspired a global movement. After years of tireless struggle, workers around the world raised their voices and secured May 1st as a day to commemorate their hard-won rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even today, the world remains unchanged in many ways. Labor continues to be the foundation upon which society is built, yet employers still fail to recognize wage laborers as human beings. Workers are often treated as mere machines, valued only for the work they produce. The environment in which many workers operate today is one where rest is a luxury, and the relentless grind leads to profound psychological, social, and economic hardships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving their wages, many workers find themselves entangled in the web of the bourgeoisie, paying rent to landlords, buying necessities from shopkeepers, or falling into debt with pawnbrokers. The fruits of their labor, instead of benefiting them, often flow back into the hands of the capitalist class. This cycle of exploitation is a grim reality that continues to perpetuate inequality and suffering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the primary duty of trade unions to guide, support, and fight for workers to ensure that they reap the benefits of their labor. As trade unions, we must rise to this challenge and march forward with unwavering determination to protect and advance the rights of all workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this International Workers&#8217; Day, let us renew our commitment to the cause. Let us stand united in the fight for fair wages, decent working conditions, and the dignity that every worker deserves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy Labor Day to all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Priya, President, TLRF<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 1st is celebrated worldwide as International Workers&#8217; Day, a day steeped in history and struggle.
