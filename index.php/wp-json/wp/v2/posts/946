Dr. Ambedkar, affectionately known as Mamedhai, emerged as a beacon of hope for the oppressed through his unwavering commitment to education and social justice, despite enduring countless humiliations throughout his life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, Ambedkar faced numerous challenges from the very start. His father, Ramji Maloji Sakpal, and his mother, Bhimabai, were his earliest influences, but even as a child, Ambedkar encountered severe discrimination. At school, he was not allowed to drink water from the common tap or share a seat with other students\u2014harsh reminders of the caste-based inequalities that plagued society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these obstacles, Ambedkar persevered, seizing every opportunity to advance his education. His determination led him abroad, where he excelled in various disciplines, including economics, political science, law, and philosophy. His academic achievements, coupled with his profound intellect, compelled the world to take notice. In England, he was honored with the title of &#8220;Barrister,&#8221; marking the beginning of his influential career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Ambedkar understood that the foundation of a progressive nation lies in its legal system. Upon assuming the role of Law Minister, he set about crafting a political framework that championed education for all, freedom, and the rights of women. He was a staunch advocate for the abolition of all forms of violence against women and the eradication of the superstitions that held them back. His vision was to eliminate the divisions and disparities that fractured society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ambedkar&#8217;s belief in the power of education over violence was unwavering. He demonstrated that true revolution comes not from swords and knives but from the pursuit of knowledge and the empowerment of the mind. He famously stated that the truly superior people are those who work to uplift the oppressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we celebrate the birth anniversary of this revolutionary leader, Dr. Annal Ambedkar, let us renew our commitment to his ideals. Let us work tirelessly for the betterment of society, the education of our children, and the welfare of the laborers. In doing so, we honor his legacy and continue the fight for equality and justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jai Bhim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Priya, President, TLRF<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar once declared, &#8220;If caste is society, let the poison spread in the wind.&#8221; These powerful words encapsulate the relentless struggle of a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-a-revolutionary-who-fought-oppression-with-education\/\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[35],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-946","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-opinion","odd"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/946"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=946"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/946\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":947,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/946\/revisions\/947"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=946"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=946"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/tlrfmdu\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=946"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
