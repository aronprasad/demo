<p>May 1st is celebrated worldwide as International Workers&#8217; Day, a day steeped in history and struggle. It is a day that honors the tens of thousands of workers who, many years ago, fought valiantly for their rights. Yet, despite the sacrifices made, the battle for fair labor conditions is far from over. The recent opposition in Tamil Nadu to the 12-hour workday bill is a stark reminder of the ongoing labor unrest and the critical importance of remembering the origins of this significant day.</p>



<p>There was a time when workers were ruthlessly exploited, forced to toil for more than 16 hours a day under inhumane conditions. It was Karl Marx who first articulated the idea that a worker&#8217;s day should be divided into three equal parts: 8 hours for work, 8 hours for rest, and 8 hours for sleep. This simple yet revolutionary concept inspired a global movement. After years of tireless struggle, workers around the world raised their voices and secured May 1st as a day to commemorate their hard-won rights.</p>



<p>However, even today, the world remains unchanged in many ways. Labor continues to be the foundation upon which society is built, yet employers still fail to recognize wage laborers as human beings. Workers are often treated as mere machines, valued only for the work they produce. The environment in which many workers operate today is one where rest is a luxury, and the relentless grind leads to profound psychological, social, and economic hardships.</p>



<p>Upon receiving their wages, many workers find themselves entangled in the web of the bourgeoisie, paying rent to landlords, buying necessities from shopkeepers, or falling into debt with pawnbrokers. The fruits of their labor, instead of benefiting them, often flow back into the hands of the capitalist class. This cycle of exploitation is a grim reality that continues to perpetuate inequality and suffering.</p>



<p>It is the primary duty of trade unions to guide, support, and fight for workers to ensure that they reap the benefits of their labor. As trade unions, we must rise to this challenge and march forward with unwavering determination to protect and advance the rights of all workers.</p>



<p>On this International Workers&#8217; Day, let us renew our commitment to the cause. Let us stand united in the fight for fair wages, decent working conditions, and the dignity that every worker deserves.</p>



<p>Happy Labor Day to all!</p>

<p>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar once declared, &#8220;If caste is society, let the poison spread in the wind.&#8221; These powerful words encapsulate the relentless struggle of a man who fought against the deeply entrenched caste oppression and untouchability in India. Dr. Ambedkar, affectionately known as Mamedhai, emerged as a beacon of hope for the oppressed through his unwavering commitment to education and social justice, despite enduring countless humiliations throughout his life.</p>



<p>Born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, Ambedkar faced numerous challenges from the very start. His father, Ramji Maloji Sakpal, and his mother, Bhimabai, were his earliest influences, but even as a child, Ambedkar encountered severe discrimination. At school, he was not allowed to drink water from the common tap or share a seat with other students—harsh reminders of the caste-based inequalities that plagued society.</p>



<p>Despite these obstacles, Ambedkar persevered, seizing every opportunity to advance his education. His determination led him abroad, where he excelled in various disciplines, including economics, political science, law, and philosophy. His academic achievements, coupled with his profound intellect, compelled the world to take notice. In England, he was honored with the title of &#8220;Barrister,&#8221; marking the beginning of his influential career.</p>



<p>Dr. Ambedkar understood that the foundation of a progressive nation lies in its legal system. Upon assuming the role of Law Minister, he set about crafting a political framework that championed education for all, freedom, and the rights of women. He was a staunch advocate for the abolition of all forms of violence against women and the eradication of the superstitions that held them back. His vision was to eliminate the divisions and disparities that fractured society.</p>



<p>Ambedkar&#8217;s belief in the power of education over violence was unwavering. He demonstrated that true revolution comes not from swords and knives but from the pursuit of knowledge and the empowerment of the mind. He famously stated that the truly superior people are those who work to uplift the oppressed.</p>



<p>As we celebrate the birth anniversary of this revolutionary leader, Dr. Annal Ambedkar, let us renew our commitment to his ideals. Let us work tirelessly for the betterment of society, the education of our children, and the welfare of the laborers. In doing so, we honor his legacy and continue the fight for equality and justice.</p>



<p>Jai Bhim!</p>

		<title>Raising a Generation of Respect: The Fight Against Gender-Based Violence</title>

<p>Violence against women remains one of the most pervasive and deeply rooted human rights violations worldwide. Despite the progress we have made in advocating for gender equality, women and girls continue to be subjected to various forms of violence—irrespective of their race, language, or religion. International Women&#8217;s Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women are observed annually to spotlight these issues and to compel action from governments, organizations, and individuals alike. Yet, the atrocities persist, often beginning within the walls of our own homes.</p>



<p>The fear that mothers have for their daughters is not rooted merely in the fact that they have given birth to a girl, but in the societal conditions into which that child is born. In many homes, boys learn oppressive behavior from the very people they trust and admire—their family members. These boys, nurtured in environments that subtly or overtly condone gender inequality, grow into men who perpetuate the cycle of violence and discrimination.</p>



<p>This is not just a societal issue; it is a deeply personal one that must be addressed at its roots. Change must begin with the family, where values are first taught and behaviors first observed. It is incumbent upon every parent to instill in their sons the principles of respect and equality from an early age. Boys must be raised to understand that men and women share equal rights, and that everyone, regardless of gender, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>



<p>By nurturing these values in our children, we can foster a society where men and women coexist as equals—where respect is not gendered, and where violence against women is unequivocally condemned. The task is not easy, but it is necessary. As parents, as educators, and as members of society, we have a responsibility to guide the next generation towards a future free from gender-based violence.</p>



<p>Let us all take this responsibility to heart. Let us teach our boys to respect girls, to value equality, and to champion the rights of all individuals. In doing so, we will raise a generation that is self-confident, courageous, and committed to creating a world where women are respected as much as men.</p>
