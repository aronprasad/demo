<p>Women leaders of Aathithamizhar union participated in a public demonstration on 1 Aug 24 along with other left unions condemning the central budget that levied more taxes on poor and low middle class families which would become the cause for inflation. They also demanded rethinking about the budget because it has helped only the corporate companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Unorganised workers of Kodaimalai union participated in a state sponsored welfare camp “Chief Minister with the People” (Makkaludan Muthalvar) on 23 Aug 24 primarily to apply for housing facilities, PATTA for houses, changing PATTA, corrections in entitlements and check dams in agriculture land. About 24 petitions were submitted for immediate action. The camp strengthened the relationship between government official and the unorganised workers.</p>



<p>On 20 Aug 24, members of Aathithamizhar union along with members of Aathithamizhar Party participated in the annual memorial event of Ondiveeran, an icon of army general from Arunthathiyar community, in Thirunelveli. The event strengthened the ideological togetherness with the party and the unions. The event also highlighted the unity among Arunthathiyars to take forward the causes of Arunthathiyars historically.&nbsp;</p>
