										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Nearly 150 women, predominantly young unorganised workers, participated in a training where they learnt all the knowledge and skills to start a new business. Union leaders explained to the participants the necessity of starting a small business primarily to go up in social and economic status. An expert, Mr shared his experience and knowledge in the field of micro, small and medium businesses. He gave them the details on the kinds of business that are feasible, the available financial support from government and other institutions and the necessary organisational structure to develop any business venture. Later about 23 of them volunteered to immediately apply for loans from banks and register with the government MSME (Micro, small and medium enterprises).</p>
